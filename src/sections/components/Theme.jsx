        <p>
          At Boston College, we are called to <strong>"set the world aflame"</strong> through acts of service, leadership, and innovation. But before we can ignite global change, we must <strong>start with our own communities.</strong> <strong>Paradise Begins Here</strong> is a challenge to create solutions that make a tangible difference in our local surroundings, knowing that the flames of positive change can spread from <strong>one neighborhood to the next.</strong> Whether it's improving local education, building sustainable initiatives, or fostering inclusive communities, paradise begins with small, purposeful actions <strong>right here at home.</strong>
